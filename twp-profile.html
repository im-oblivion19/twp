        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This is an image of a face mask. It is black in color and feels slightly crispy rather than smooth because it is disposable. 
            I acquired this mask during the COVID quarantine, when my family bought a large pack of 150 face masks. We later switched to 
            cotton reusable masks, so these disposable ones were rarely used. When I moved into my dorm for the Spring semester, I brought 
            about 100 unused masks from that pack with me.
        </p>
        <p>
            I first used one last week while cleaning a dusty area in my room. It works well for short-term use, but it is not very 
            comfortable. Breathing through it feels like breathing through a thin napkin, and it has a slight smell. I am discarding it 
            because it was used for a long time and also fell on the ground, making it dirty.
        </p>

        <h2>Anecdote</h2>
        <p>
            After sitting unused for nearly six years, it was finally time to wear the mask. I had been away from my dorm for a month, 
            and the room needed cleaning. There was a gap between the drawer cabinet and wardrobe that had collected a significant amount 
            of dust. I took a mask from the pack and put it on. As I adjusted it over my nose and under my chin, it immediately felt stuffy 
            and fogged up my glasses.
        </p>
        <p>
            That discomfort made sense, since masks are designed to filter particles from the air. While cleaning, it effectively prevented 
            dust from entering my nose and mouth. After finishing, I discarded it because the front was likely covered in dust. As I removed 
            it, I accidentally dropped it on the floor. In a college dorm environment, anything that falls on the floor should not be reused, 
            so I threw it away.
        </p>

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p><strong>Facts:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>About 75% of used face masks end up in landfills or floating in the sea.</li>
            <li>COVID-19 led to a significant increase in the production of face masks.</li>
        </ul>
